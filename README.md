# SafeRoute-AI
### An AI-Powered Automated Safety Check-In Agent for Women, sends real-time notifications to family when you enter/exit metro or college.
  
  Built for Kaggle x Google 5-Day AI Agent Intensive

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
As a college student traveling through unsafe or high-risk routes, I often forget to update my parents when I check in/out of metro stations.  
This small delay creates **panic, anxiety, and uncertainty** — especially during late travel hours.

Millions of students, working women, and commuters face this same problem:
- Forgetting to notify family  
- No automatic alert system  
- Safety uncertainty during solo travel  

**SafeRoute AI** solves this by sending **automatic, real-time safety notifications** to trusted contacts whenever the user enters or exits the metro.

## 🤖 Why Agents?  
Agents are ideal because:
- They automate repetitive human actions  
- They follow rules and trigger automatically (no manual messaging)  
- They integrate AI + Webhooks + Messaging channels  
- They work autonomously in the background  

SafeRoute AI uses an AI Agent to:
1. Receive metro check-in event  
2. Understand the context (check-in or check-out)  
3. Format it into a clear alert  
4. Send it to family email or WhatsApp automatically

## 🏗️ What I Built — Architecture Overview  
SafeRoute AI is a **agent** built using:

- **automation workflow** 
- **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** (AI reasoning + message generation)  
- **Webhook Triggers** (simulate metro check-in/check-out event)  
- **Email Notifications** (default output channel)  
- Optional: WhatsApp Business Cloud API  

### High-Level Architecture


You can view the full architecture in `architecture.png`.

## 🎥 Demo  
The agent can be tested by sending any event to the webhook URL generated in Make.com.

Example demo event:

{
"event": "check_in",
"location": "Kashmere Gate Metro Station",
"timestamp": "2025-11-29T10:13:00Z"
}

Resulting output:
User has safely checked IN at Kashmere Gate Metro Station (10:13 AM).
Notification sent to family.


Demo details available in `demo.md`.

## 🛠️ The Build — Tools & Technologies  
| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Integration** | workflow automation |
| **Google Gemini Flash 1.5** | AI reasoning + message creation |
| **Custom Webhook** | Metro event trigger |
| **Email Module** | Sends alerts to trusted contacts |
| **JSON + Pseudocode** | Technical documentation for reproducibility |

Files included:
- `agent_workflow.json` — JSON representation of the Make workflow  
- `pseudocode.py` — Logic representation of the agent  
- `demo.md` — Live demo instructions

## ⏳ If I Had More Time  
I would extend SafeRoute AI into a full civic-tech safety tool:
- Add **GPS-based auto-detection** instead of manual punching  
- Enable **WhatsApp push notifications**  
- Add **panic button alerts**  
- Integrate **Delhi Metro API** for real-time station logs  
- Add **location-sharing timeline** for families  
- Deploy as a **mobile app** with background activity  

The agent uses Make.com as the cloud execution layer. The architecture includes input triggers (Telegram), an agent reasoning block, and outgoing actions (email notifications). Context and grounding are passed through the workflow.
The agent is deployed privately on Make.com. For security reasons, the webhook URL is not public. Reproduction instructions are included.
